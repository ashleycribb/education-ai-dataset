# School Implementation Roadmap & Support Strategy for AITA Ecosystem

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines a strategic roadmap and support plan for facilitating the adoption and effective utilization of the AI Tutor (AITA) ecosystem by K-12 schools and districts. It considers different levels of technical capacity and aims to provide a clear path for integrating AITAs into diverse educational environments.

### Goal
Our goal is to make AITA integration as seamless, secure, and pedagogically effective as possible, ensuring that AITAs become valuable tools for both students and educators, enhancing personalized learning and data-informed instruction.

## 2. Phased Integration Models for Schools

We propose three phased models for AITA adoption, allowing schools to start with simpler setups and progressively move towards deeper integration as their capacity and needs evolve.

*   **Model 1: Standalone Pilot / Classroom Deployment (AITA-in-a-Box)**
    *   **Description**: This model focuses on demonstrating the pedagogical value and core functionality of AITAs with minimal technical overhead for the school. The AITA client (e.g., a web-based version of `aita_mcp_client.py`) runs with either a very basic mock context server (like `lms_mcp_server_mock.py` configured with specific scenarios) or manually configured context relevant to a particular classroom's needs.
    *   **Technical Requirements**: Minimal. Devices for students (tablets, laptops), a way to run the AITA client and its backend (could be on a local machine managed by a teacher/facilitator, or a simple cloud instance).
    *   **Data Flow**: Interaction data (`xapi_statements.jsonl`) is collected locally. The `teacher_dashboard_prototype.py` can be used to review this data.
    *   **Focus**: Pedagogical demonstration, usability testing, gathering initial teacher/student feedback on the AITA's interaction style and content.
    *   **Support Needed**: Simple setup instructions, pre-configured AITA packages for specific lessons.

*   **Model 2: LMS Integration via LTI (Key Integration Model)**
    *   **Description**: The AITA Interaction Service is exposed as an LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) tool. Students launch the AITA from within their existing school LMS (e.g., Canvas, Schoology, Google Classroom).
    *   **Technical Requirements**:
        *   The school's LMS must support LTI (most modern LMSs do).
        *   The AITA Interaction Service needs to be hosted (e.g., in the cloud or on a school/district server) and configured as an LTI Tool Provider.
        *   Basic user identity and course/activity context are passed from the LMS to the AITA upon launch.
    *   **Data Flow**:
        *   LMS -> (LTI Launch with Context) -> AITA Interaction Service.
        *   AITA Interaction Service -> (xAPI statements) -> Learning Record Store (LRS), which could be cloud-based or district-hosted.
    *   **Focus**: Seamless student access, basic context awareness, and centralized data logging to an LRS. This is a crucial model for wider adoption.
    *   **Support Needed**: LTI integration guides for common LMSs, documentation on configuring the AITA service as an LTI tool, LRS setup/integration support.

*   **Model 3: Deeper Data Synchronization & Analytics Integration**
    *   **Description**: This model involves richer data exchange between the AITA ecosystem and other school data systems (SIS, comprehensive LMS APIs, data warehouses).
    *   **Technical Requirements**:
        *   Implementation of an "LMS-Adapter-MCP-Server" that can communicate with specific school SIS/LMS APIs using standards like OneRoster, Ed-Fi, or proprietary APIs to fetch more detailed context.
        *   A robust LRS for storing xAPI data generated by the AITA.
        *   Potentially, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to move/map AITA interaction data from the LRS into the school district's data warehouse for combined analytics.
        *   The Teacher Dashboard would source data from the LRS and potentially other school data systems.
    *   **Data Flow**:
        *   School SIS/LMS -> (OneRoster/Ed-Fi/API) -> LMS-Adapter-MCP-Server -> (MCP) -> AITA Interaction Service.
        *   AITA Interaction Service -> (xAPI) -> LRS.
        *   LRS -> (API/ETL) -> District Data Warehouse / Teacher Dashboard.
    *   **Focus**: Highly personalized AITA interactions based on rich student data, comprehensive learning analytics, and integration with district-wide data strategies.
    *   **Support Needed**: Development of specific MCP adapters for common school systems, data mapping guides (e.g., xAPI to Ed-Fi), LRS implementation support, advanced dashboard customization.

## 3. Key Development Roadmap Items for Integration Support

To facilitate the integration models described above, the following software development tasks are key:

*   **LTI Tool Provider Capability for AITA Interaction Service**:
    *   Implement LTI 1.3 (and potentially LTI Advantage) compliance within the `aita_interaction_service.py` (or a wrapper around it). This will allow it to be launched as an external tool from any LTI-compliant LMS.
    *   Handle LTI launch parameters to securely receive user identity, course context, and resource link information.

*   **Reference "LMS-Adapter-MCP-Server" Implementations**:
    *   Develop a reference implementation of an MCP server (using `k12_mcp_server_sdk`) that can consume data from common school sources.
        *   **Example 1: OneRoster CSV Consumption**: An adapter that can read OneRoster CSV files (commonly exported by SISs) to provide student, course, and enrollment context via MCP.
        *   **Example 2 (Conceptual): Canvas API Adapter**: An adapter that connects to the Canvas LMS API to fetch richer, real-time context. This would serve as a template for adapters for other major LMSs.
    *   These adapters would translate data from school systems into the MCP format expected by the AITA client logic.

*   **LRS Connector & Enhanced xAPI Conformance**:
    *   Develop a robust "LRS Connector" module for `aita_mcp_client.py` (or the backend `AITA Interaction Service`) to reliably send xAPI statements to a standard LRS endpoint.
    *   Ensure the xAPI statements generated are fully conformant with common xAPI profiles used in education and provide comprehensive details for learning analytics.

*   **(Conceptual) Data Mapping & ETL Utilities**:
    *   Design and prototype utilities or provide guidance for mapping xAPI statements from AITA interactions to other data models used in schools, such as Ed-Fi.
    *   Provide examples of how AITA data could be ETL'd into a school data warehouse to be combined with other student data for holistic analytics.

## 4. Documentation Suite for Schools

A comprehensive documentation suite is essential for successful adoption.

*   **For School IT Staff / Administrators**:
